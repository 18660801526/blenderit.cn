              <p>Export animated cameras, lights, images, other object locations and
tracking markers from Blender to Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Exporting from Blender</h3>
<p>Activate the extension by going to the Extensions section of the user
preferences, search for “After” and click the check box to the
left of the result.</p>
<p>The exporter is then available from the File Menu (F4), Export, Adobe
After Effects (.jsx). Select the file name and options, and hit the
“Export to Adobe After Effects” button.</p>
<p>You can also set up an exporter from the collection properties.</p>
<h3>Importing into After Effects</h3>
<p>The generated file is an ExtendScript file that can be loaded into
After Effects. To import the scene, you can open After Effects and go
to the File menu, Scripts, Run Script File... and select the .jsx
file. This will prompt you for a composition name and create it, with
the cameras and objects set up.</p>
<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>This exporter was originally written by Bartek Skorupa with
contributions by Thomas Volkmann, Atom, Adam Wasila, Paolo Ciccone,
François Tarlier, and Campbell Barton.</p>
<p>It is currently maintained by Les Fées Spéciales.</p>
