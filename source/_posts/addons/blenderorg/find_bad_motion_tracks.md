              <p>This extension finds bad motion tracking tracks.</p>
<p>The way it works is that it highlights tracks that move differently from the others.</p>
<p>Basically, if all tracks move to the right, except one that moves to the left, then the single track moving to the left is likely wrong and should be evaluated by a human.</p>
<p>Compared to the Refine tracking solution add-on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find Bad Tracks</strong> aims at helping you get rid of bad tracks before camera tracking</li>
<li><strong>Refine tracking solution</strong> aims at handling bad tracks during camera tracking</li>
</ul>
