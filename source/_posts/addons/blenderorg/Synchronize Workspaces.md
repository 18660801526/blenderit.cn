              <p>Imagine how much time you waste restoring viewport position every time, then switching on a different workspace in Blender! With this add-on, you can switch between them fluently, because this add-on keeps viewport position between different workspaces. It is that simple as it is.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can disable synchronization for specific workspaces, or switch on/off using a widget.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add-on can also keep your viewport &amp; overlay settings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Note, that add-on synchronizes the biggest 3D View in the workspace.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
