              <p>Sun Position allows positioning and animating the Sun (to a certain
degree of accuracy), to simulate real-world natural lighting. It uses
physical characteristics to position the Sun in the scene: geographic
location, time and date. It is based on the Earth System Research
Laboratory’s <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/">online calculator</a>.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This add-on has two distinct modes of operation: the Normal
Mode allows you to animate the Sun realistically, while
the Environment Mode is useful for synchronizing
a sun light to an environment texture.</p>
<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
<p>This is the mode by default. After selecting the time and place, you
can set up a sun light, a sky texture, and a collection to serve as
visualization. They will be position or animated by choosing a date,
time and place on Earth.</p>
<h3>Environment Mode</h3>
<p>Instead of simulating the position of the Sun for a real location and
time, this mode simply locks an environment texture with a sun light
object. They are synchronized and will rotate at the same time. It is
useful if you want to increase the contrast in an environment texture
by using an additional Sun.</p>
<h2>Translations</h2>
<p>The add-on is currently available in English and French. If you’d like
to help translate it to your language, please <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://projects.blender.org/pioverfour/sun_position/issues">open an

<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>This add-on was originally written by Michael Martin with
contributions by Aaron Carlisle, Brendon Murphy, Campbell Barton,
Eduardo Schilling, Julian Eisel, n-Burn, and Stephen Leger. It uses
the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://hoegners.de/Maxi/geo/">geo.py</a> module by Maximilian
Hoegner.</p>
<p>It is currently maintained by Damien Picard.</p>
