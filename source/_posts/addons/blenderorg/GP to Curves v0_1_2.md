              <p>Grease Pencil to Curves add-on allows you to easily smooth the lines drawn with Grease Pencil in Blender, reduce the number of vertices, and convert to curves with one button.  This eliminates a lot of work in shaping Bezier curves from scratch.  You can also convert the resulting curve to a hair curve attached to a surface with a single click, allowing you to turn multiple grease pencil strokes into hair curves that are already aligned to the surface (giving you a head start in grooming).  Each grease pencil layer creates a separate curve.  You also have the option to resample generated curves to increase points.  The add-on menu appears in the N-Panel within the "Edit" tab.</p>
<p>You can do all of this manually, but this addon does all the conversion, adjusting number of segments, smoothing, and attaching more easily in a single menu.</p>
<p>In the addon overview on Youtube, I demonstrate a line drawn with Grease Pencil converted a curve to quickly create a chain and a string of lights.  I then generate a whole head of hair from grease pencil strokes.</p>
