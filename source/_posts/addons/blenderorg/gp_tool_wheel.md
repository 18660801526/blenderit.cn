              <p>Are you using Grease Pencil and find yourself switching a lot between modes and tools? Then GP Tool Wheel can speed up your workflow: it combines mode and tool selection in one delicious wheel.</p>
<h3>How to use the wheel – press <code>F8</code></h3>
<p>By default you can invoke the tool wheel with the shortcut <code>F8</code>. You can change this shortcut easily by customizing your wheel.</p>
<p>The wheel only appears when there is an active Grease Pencil object. Future Grease Pencil version 3 is already supported.</p>
<p>Selecting a tool needs no explanation: click on an icon and you are good to go.</p>
<h3>Customize your wheel</h3>
<p>You can customize your wheel in the add-on preferences.</p>
<p>Go to <code>Edit</code> &gt; <code>Preferences...</code> &gt; <code>Extensions</code> and look for <code>GP Tool Wheel</code>. Click on the arrow on the left.</p>
<p>Here you can compose your ideal, tailor made wheel. Perhaps you want to change it in a kind of 'Quick favorites' menu, with only the modes and tools you often use. Or assign <code>Tab</code> as shortcut, replacing the default pie menu.</p>
<p>In the preferences, you can define:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyboard shortcut to invoke the wheel.</li>
<li>The order of the modes.</li>
<li>The tools that appear in the wheel.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can save and load your wheel preferences for distribution to other devices or Blender installs.</p>
