              <h2>Context sensitive pie menu</h2>
<p>Meant to work in conjunction with Blender's official pie-menu add-on. Brings pie menus to poly modeling, curve editing, uv mapping and animation. Replaces the traditional context sensitive menu with a pie menu, enabling many more functions on the same hotkey. Pie menus gets faster to navigate as muscle memory kicks in and lets you focus on the task at hand. Operations are sensibly placed across contexts. The top option in Edit Mesh mode will "Merge". In Object mode it will "Join" and in Edit Curve it will "Make Segment" between selected points etc.</p>
<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<p><strong>Right Mouse</strong> :                    Mode selection pie menu</p>
<p><strong>Shift + Right Mouse</strong>:        Context sensitive pie menu</p>
<p>Made with inspiration from an ancient Mayan pie recipe and works well with the industry compatible keymap.</p>
