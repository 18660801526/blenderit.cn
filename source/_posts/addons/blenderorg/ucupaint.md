            <div class="box style-rich-text">
              <p>Ucupaint is a Blender addon to manage texture layers for the Eevee and Cycles renderers. Already in development for years, Ucupaint provides a lot of easy-to-use features while also being able to fit into your usual shader nodes workflow.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stack images, vertex attributes, generated textures, or many other types into layers or masks.</li>
<li>All Ucupaint nodes are contained inside a single node group so you can connect it to any of your other nodes.</li>
<li>Channels in Ucupaint are flexible, you can add or remove them based on your needs.</li>
<li>You can add modifiers like a color ramp or math operation to your layer or mask for quick adjustments.</li>
<li>Works well with multiple objects with the same materials.</li>
<li>UDIM is detected automatically based on UV islands when creating a new image layer or mask.</li>
<li>Bake final channel images and easily arrange them so most exporters can read them.</li>
<li>Easily set up transparency by enabling alpha channel in a single click.</li>
<li>Bake AO, multires, other object's normal, and more.</li>
<li>Ability to use smoother bump map at the expense of performance and precision.</li>
<li>Preview mode to check your layers or channel colors.</li>
<li>Pack baked channel results into a single image using a custom bake target (useful for creating ORM texture or DirectX normal).</li>
<li>And so much more.</li>
