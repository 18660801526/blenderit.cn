              <p>Have you ever faced the problem of pressing F12 and a weird mesh popping up on your pretty render? And then you have to search through dozens of folders and subfolders to find that wild mesh to disable it for the render, only to fail? Well, this addon will certainly help you with this task.</p>
<p>Mismatched objects = Hidden on Viewport but not in Render or Vice-versa. (Also for collections if it is not marked as excluded in the Render Layer).</p>
