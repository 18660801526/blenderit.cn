<p>Description: 
The Maze Generator is a Blender add-on designed to create customizable, random maze meshes within Blender. This tool is ideal for users in game development, architectural visualization, or artistic projects who need to quickly generate complex mazes with various configurations.</p>

<p>Solidify Modifier: 
Optionally apply a solidify modifier to give thickness to maze walls, enhancing the 3D appearance.</p>
<p>Bevel Modifier: 
Optionally apply a bevel modifier to smooth out the edges of the maze walls, providing a more polished look.</p>
<p>Advanced Configuration Options: 
Includes settings for random seed input, allowing users to reproduce specific mazes consistently. Additional controls for deleting isolated sections ("islands") of the maze and adjusting the complexity through iterations.</p>
<p>Real-time Updates:
