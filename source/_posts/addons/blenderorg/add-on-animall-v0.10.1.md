              <p>AnimAll is a Blender add-on which allows you to add keyframes to many
object properties not usually animated directly.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The AnimAll interface is located in the <code>3D Viewport → Side bar → Animation → AnimAll</code> panel. There, you’ll see a column of options for
what type of data you want to animate, and buttons that allow you to
insert keyframes for them.</p>
<p>For instance, say you want to trace a curve around a moving object on
a reference footage. You can:</p>
<ol>
<li>start by adding a curve,</li>
<li>go into Edit Mode,</li>
<li>shape it where you want it at the first frame,</li>
<li>enable the Location checkbox,</li>
<li>hit Insert Key,</li>
<li>move forward a few frames in time, then start again at step 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you go back to Object Mode and scrub the timeline, you’ll see
your curve is now animated. In addition, all the new keyframes are
editable in the animation editors (Dope Sheet, Graph Editor, etc.),
grouped by element.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of the selected objects, different properties
are available to animate. The types of objects animatable through
AnimAll are meshes, curves, surfaces, and lattices.</p>
<p>If you only want part of the object to be animated, you can enable Key
Selected Only. After that, only the selected elements (vertices,
edges, faces, control points, etc.) will be animated when you insert
keyframes.</p>
